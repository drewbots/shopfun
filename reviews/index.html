			<h5>"Where to begin? Without sounding cliche, I would say...a slice of paradise. Surf n Sol was more than I ever expected. For me, Surf n Sol was a life-altering experience and if you have the opportunity, I would say...BOOK YOUR TRIP. You'll never forget it!!!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave - Maine</h5>

			<h5>"These guys were great! Spent a week in Hanalei with them in February 2010 and had a great time - the house was beautiful and comfortable, the meals were organic, fresh, and delicious and Andrew was great about recognizing food allergies/sensitivities. These guys were attentive and fun and the trip is great for solo travelers and groups alike. Can't wait to visit them again (Oahu!)" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison - Seattle</h5>
